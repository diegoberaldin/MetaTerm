Project documentation
=====================

This section contains the documentation that has been automatically extracted from source files with the ``sphinx`` tool.

It will be divided into three sections, namely one for the application data model, one for the controller and a last
one for the GUI, which reflect the MVC architectural pattern that has been adopted in order to design the overall
application architecture.
