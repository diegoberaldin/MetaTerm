Welcome to MetaTerm's documentation!
====================================

MetaTerm is intended to be a 'not-so-pretentious' terminology management application written in Python.

The project depends on SQLAlchemy in order to handle data persistence in local SQLite databases (often referred to as
'termbases') and on the PyQt4 library which is used as a graphical toolkit and to provide an easy to use and extensible
publisher-subscriber mechanism for the communication between the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the controller on
the one side, and between (a subset of) model classes and the GUI.
